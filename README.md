# Personal Second Brain — Documentation

This repository is the **single source of truth for product and architecture decisions**.
It lives outside the code on purpose: the code repo (`../second-brain/`) contains only
implementation plus a `CLAUDE.md` that points here.

## Current status (snapshot — 2026-07-19)

> This section is a **snapshot, updated in place** each session. The full session-by-session
> history lives in **[08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)** (append-only —
> a superseded snapshot entry moves there verbatim). The authoritative build state is
> **[08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md)** + **[08-logs/](08-logs/)**.

**Live at `https://braindan.cc` — M0 through M8.2 all closed.** The graph-native stack
([ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)–029 pivot, M3): capture
(voice/text/MCP) → organizer (single writer; typed nodes + edges, entity resolution, alias
accretion, diacritic folding) → `PSB-graph` git store → index/hybrid search (vector ⊍ FTS RRF +
recency + profile leg). Grounded cited **chat** with UI-editable model routing
(`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`; provider ≠ model, [ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md))
+ provider observability (M4). **MCP server behind self-hosted OAuth 2.1** — connector-verified
on Claude (mobile/web) *and* ChatGPT (M5); identity capsule L0. **Pipeline scheduling primitive**
(M5.5, [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md)). **Chat distiller** with stance gate,
watermarks, salience, dedup sweep + merge core, inbox drainer, one-tap remove (M6,
[ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md)/[049](adr/049-dedup-sweep-merge-core-build-decisions.md)).
**Map/Explore** constellation UI (M7/M8.1), **ops console + observability** (M8,
[ADR-053](adr/053-m8-ops-console-observability-build-decisions.md)), **graph-health**.
**Interiority + temporal correctness** (M8.2, [ADR-055](adr/055-interiority-inner-voice-first-class.md)/[056](adr/056-temporal-correctness-date-tokens.md)):
"LLMs classify, code computes" (hard rule 12), anchored symbolic time-refs → `[[t:…]]` tokens,
inner-voice extraction; prod reprocessed (41/41 captures, 160 nodes). Durability: everything
derived rebuilds from the store (`reprocess-all-from-raw`, vision P10,
[ADR-042](adr/042-reprocess-all-from-raw-and-data-survival.md)); reindex parity verified live.

**Where we are (2026-07-19):** **M9.8 T7 live Accept STARTED — T7.0 pre-flight fixes done, awaiting
deploy.** T1–T6 are **pushed** (`main` == `origin/main` == `29c15a2`); the live T7 drive then
surfaced **three defects in the built T6/T4 web surfaces** a dev-mount review couldn't catch, now
**fixed (T7.0, web-only, ADR-006-clean, no server change)**: ① graph-health Delete/Keep/Merge only
"settled" in ephemeral state → re-appeared on any remount ("shows up again unless I re-run graph
health") — now **durable** (`useResolvedRunItems`, `localStorage` keyed by `runId`, + live-keeps
reconciliation; same fix on the Duplicate-candidates card; `MergeIntoPanel` gained `onMerged`); ②
the **merge picker was unreachable** inside the bottom-sheet drawer (absolute `top:100%` dropdown
clipped off the sheet edge) → now **in-flow** so it rides the sheet scroll; ③ **`entity-dedup` in
Review wasn't actionable** (no card for the kind → badge-only) → new **`EntityDedupCard`**
(survivor-pick Merge / keep, calling the existing resolver). Gate green (tsc + eslint + vite build);
independent diff review **no must-fix**. **Not yet committed→pushed** — needs a deploy before the
**T7.1 live drills**. All four drill fixtures confirmed live (`entity_merges`/`orphan_keeps` = 0):
the **Diana Vance** dup (`0bd6f214`) vs the **Diana** hub (`8e874e52`), **Diana Wren** (`f1ad15ee`,
the negative control), zero-degree orphan hubs (`gluten-free baking` …), and **Father** (`db99f269`)
for the keep drill. *(T6, now superseded here, is archived in [status history](08-logs/status-history.md).)*

<!-- superseded T6 snapshot retained below for the As-built detail; see 08 for the authoritative state -->
The graph-health card's **orphan-nodes** check is now
inline-actionable ([ADR-064](adr/064-durable-merges-visual-dedup-gc.md) §3/§5): each **hub** offender
gets **Delete** (`POST /admin/nodes/{id}/delete`, T5 — confirm-gated + run-poll; `409`→Merge,
`400`→content-note, `404`→gone), **Merge** (reuses the shared **`MergeIntoPanel`** picker
propose→apply, orphan = loser — the T3 flow, no fork), and **Keep** (`POST /admin/nodes/{id}/keep`,
T5.5); acted-on rows settle to a **local resolved state** (the flagged sample is a *past* run's
immutable details). A collapsible **"Kept (N)"** strip (`GET /admin/orphan-keeps`) with **Un-keep**
(`DELETE /admin/orphan-keeps/{key}`, keyed on the stable key) renders **even at orphan-count 0**;
**content** orphans get only a degraded capture-tab note. A new **Duplicate candidates** card reads
the latest **`entity-dedup`** run's `details.high_confidence[]` off the roster (same mechanism as the
health card), one **pre-filled** propose→confirm→apply **Merge** per pair (T4); low-confidence pairs
link to **Review**. **Web only** (ADR-006 — no server change). Independent review (**fresh
general-purpose agent**, plan + diff + server contract): **all 5 acceptance criteria met, no
must-fix**; two minors fixed (delete-progress feedback; a `GET /types` loading guard so hubs aren't
briefly mislabeled content). Gate green (**tsc + eslint + vite build**; dev server mounts, no console
errors). The **live** orphan-delete / dedup-merge / keep-survives-reprocess drills are **T7**.
*(M9.7 + M9.6 T6 + M9.8 T1–T5.5 closed prior — see [status history](08-logs/status-history.md);
M9.8 grilled to build-ready in [ADR-064](adr/064-durable-merges-visual-dedup-gc.md).)*

**Repo hygiene (2026-07-19):** a **PII history-rewrite** (`git filter-repo` + force-push) of **both
public repos** replaced every real contact's full name with a fabricated stand-in (real first name
kept, so code examples still work: e.g. Horia Fenwick, Diana Vance, Madalina Fairfax); a **hashed
pre-commit guard** (`.githooks/pre-commit` → `pii_scan.py`, wire with `git config core.hooksPath
.githooks`) blocks re-introduction. The CI **deploy** step was hardened from `git pull --ff-only` to
**`git fetch + reset --hard origin/main`** so a force-push no longer wedges the VPS deploy (07-infra).
⚠ GitHub may still serve pre-rewrite commits by SHA until GC — verify no forks.

**Next:** **deploy T7.0** (commit the web fixes → push → CI deploys), then run **T7.1 — the live
drills** on the deployed stack, in this order (all actions **before** a single `reprocess-all`): ①
run `entity-dedup` + `graph-health` so the ops cards populate (do **not** reprocess first); ② merge
the **Diana Vance → Diana** pair via the picker (no ids) + inline-merge a *second* detected pair,
confirming **Diana Wren** is never proposed; ③ delete an orphan **hub**; ④ **Keep** `Father`; ⑤ **one**
`reprocess-all`, then verify against the DB that the merge replayed (`entity_merges`=1, `Diana Vance`
still tombstoned), the deleted orphan didn't resurrect, and `Father`/`orphan_keeps` survived. The
**T7.0 web fixes are committed locally but not pushed** (pushing code is the operator's call).
*(Separate background task in flight: the identity-capsule L0 generator-preamble leak.)*

The production graph store lives on the VPS ([ADR-001](adr/001-vault-on-vps-with-git-backup.md) +
[ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)).

## Cold start — instructions for a fresh implementation session

If you are an AI (or human) picking this up with no prior context:

0. Follow the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md): **planning/replanning** sessions
   `/grilling` first, record decisions to docs, and **pause before implementation** so the
   user can continue or respawn; **implementation** sessions build against the approved plan
   (no grilling), pausing between tasks. Commit + push docs at every pause.
1. Read the docs in the order above; skim every ADR — they are binding.
2. The code monorepo lives at `../second-brain/` (server/, web/, deploy/, tools/;
   its `CLAUDE.md` carries the binding implementation rules).
3. Implement strictly by phases in [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md),
   starting at the first milestone whose acceptance criteria don't pass yet. Do not skip ahead.
4. Anything ambiguous or contradictory: fix the docs first (new ADR if architectural),
   then implement. Never silently diverge from these documents.
5. Things intentionally NOT decided yet (ask the user when reached): Slack app creation (M12);
   exact vision model ids (M9 T1 — verified against live Groq/Nebius catalogs at build).
   Already provisioned: domain (`braindan.cc`), Cloudflare, Supabase, code repo, `PSB-graph`
   (+ VPS deploy key, write access).
6. Update the **Current status** snapshot above **in place** at every pause; move the
   superseded entry verbatim to [08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)
   (append-only). Never let state live only in chat.

## Rules of this repo

- Behavior changes in code **must** be reflected here first or alongside — docs are the contract.
- New architectural choices get a new ADR; existing ADRs are never edited, only superseded.
- Docs are written to be directly ingestible by an AI implementer (Claude Code).
- **This repo is public: no real names, no relationship details, no personal data** — use
  placeholders (P1/P2) in logs; the triage manifest and export data stay local, gitignored. A
  **pre-commit guard** (`.githooks/pre-commit` → `pii_scan.py`, a SHA-256 denylist) blocks any real
  contact's full name; wire it on a fresh clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Example
  people in docs/code use fabricated names (Diana Vance, Horia Fenwick, …).
