# Personal Second Brain — Documentation

This repository is the **single source of truth for product and architecture decisions**.
It lives outside the code on purpose: the code repo (`../second-brain/`) contains only
implementation plus a `CLAUDE.md` that points here.

## Current status (snapshot — 2026-07-19)

> This section is a **snapshot, updated in place** each session. The full session-by-session
> history lives in **[08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)** (append-only —
> a superseded snapshot entry moves there verbatim). The authoritative build state is
> **[08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md)** + **[08-logs/](08-logs/)**.

**Live at `https://braindan.cc` — M0 through M8.2 all closed.** The graph-native stack
([ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)–029 pivot, M3): capture
(voice/text/MCP) → organizer (single writer; typed nodes + edges, entity resolution, alias
accretion, diacritic folding) → `PSB-graph` git store → index/hybrid search (vector ⊍ FTS RRF +
recency + profile leg). Grounded cited **chat** with UI-editable model routing
(`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`; provider ≠ model, [ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md))
+ provider observability (M4). **MCP server behind self-hosted OAuth 2.1** — connector-verified
on Claude (mobile/web) *and* ChatGPT (M5); identity capsule L0. **Pipeline scheduling primitive**
(M5.5, [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md)). **Chat distiller** with stance gate,
watermarks, salience, dedup sweep + merge core, inbox drainer, one-tap remove (M6,
[ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md)/[049](adr/049-dedup-sweep-merge-core-build-decisions.md)).
**Map/Explore** constellation UI (M7/M8.1), **ops console + observability** (M8,
[ADR-053](adr/053-m8-ops-console-observability-build-decisions.md)), **graph-health**.
**Interiority + temporal correctness** (M8.2, [ADR-055](adr/055-interiority-inner-voice-first-class.md)/[056](adr/056-temporal-correctness-date-tokens.md)):
"LLMs classify, code computes" (hard rule 12), anchored symbolic time-refs → `[[t:…]]` tokens,
inner-voice extraction; prod reprocessed (41/41 captures, 160 nodes). Durability: everything
derived rebuilds from the store (`reprocess-all-from-raw`, vision P10,
[ADR-042](adr/042-reprocess-all-from-raw-and-data-survival.md)); reindex parity verified live.

**Where we are (2026-07-19):** **M9 T6 live Accept STARTED then paused for a planning pivot; M9.6
composite capture GRILLED TO BUILD-READY.** The M9 media stack (T1–T5) is shipped and **live on
prod**: this session pushed it (`2629053`), CI deployed it (migrations **017+018** applied), the
**`voice-media-backfill`** op ran, and **Accept ¶1** (real-phone photo → described/organized
media-backed node, inline in NodePreview + lightbox + "see raw capture") + the **session gate**
(`GET /api/v1/media/{id}` → **401** without a cookie) verified live. A capture-screen
**preview-centering bug** found during ¶1 — the `Lightbox`/`CaptureDetailSheet` overlays are
`position:fixed` but were trapped inside framer-motion-transformed capture rows — was fixed by
**portaling both overlays to `<body>`** and **shipped** (`8579974`, deployed). Then the user
requested **composite multi-part capture** (one capture carrying text + several photos + a voice
note, organized together) — an architecture change, so per [09](09-session-protocol.md) the session
**switched to a grilling/planning pass** and recorded
**[ADR-061](adr/061-composite-multi-part-capture.md)** + a new
**[M9.6](08-implementation-plan.md)** milestone: server-side **draft** compose → **one blended
organize**; capture = typed text + 0..N photos + ≤1 voice; **per-node media attribution**;
`raw_text` stays the cached assembled replay source (reprocess byte-parity). **M9 T6 is superseded
by M9.6** — its remaining single-part drills fold into the M9.6 live Accept. **No composite code
written yet** (planning pause).
**Next:** implement **M9.6** against the approved plan ([08 §M9.6](08-implementation-plan.md) +
[ADR-061](adr/061-composite-multi-part-capture.md)) — **strictly sequential** T1 (draft lifecycle +
schema) → T2 (blended `_process` + assembly + concurrent derivation) → T3 (per-node attribution +
organizer contract) → T4 (API views + fold endpoints) → T5 (compose web) → T6 (live M9.6 Accept,
folding the M9 T6 drills). Or respawn.

> **Planning/replanning sessions start with `/grilling`; implementation sessions build
> against the approved plan (no grilling). Every session follows
> [09-session-protocol.md](09-session-protocol.md).**

The production graph store lives on the VPS ([ADR-001](adr/001-vault-on-vps-with-git-backup.md) +
[ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)).

## Cold start — instructions for a fresh implementation session

If you are an AI (or human) picking this up with no prior context:

0. Follow the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md): **planning/replanning** sessions
   `/grilling` first, record decisions to docs, and **pause before implementation** so the
   user can continue or respawn; **implementation** sessions build against the approved plan
   (no grilling), pausing between tasks. Commit + push docs at every pause.
1. Read the docs in the order above; skim every ADR — they are binding.
2. The code monorepo lives at `../second-brain/` (server/, web/, deploy/, tools/;
   its `CLAUDE.md` carries the binding implementation rules).
3. Implement strictly by phases in [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md),
   starting at the first milestone whose acceptance criteria don't pass yet. Do not skip ahead.
4. Anything ambiguous or contradictory: fix the docs first (new ADR if architectural),
   then implement. Never silently diverge from these documents.
5. Things intentionally NOT decided yet (ask the user when reached): Slack app creation (M12);
   exact vision model ids (M9 T1 — verified against live Groq/Nebius catalogs at build).
   Already provisioned: domain (`braindan.cc`), Cloudflare, Supabase, code repo, `PSB-graph`
   (+ VPS deploy key, write access).
6. Update the **Current status** snapshot above **in place** at every pause; move the
   superseded entry verbatim to [08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)
   (append-only). Never let state live only in chat.

## Rules of this repo

- Behavior changes in code **must** be reflected here first or alongside — docs are the contract.
- New architectural choices get a new ADR; existing ADRs are never edited, only superseded.
- Docs are written to be directly ingestible by an AI implementer (Claude Code).
- **This repo is public: no real names, no relationship details, no personal data** — use
  placeholders (P1/P2) in logs; the triage manifest and export data stay local, gitignored.
