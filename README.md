# Personal Second Brain — Documentation

This repository is the **single source of truth for product and architecture decisions**.
It lives outside the code on purpose: the code repo (`../second-brain/`) contains only
implementation plus a `CLAUDE.md` that points here.

**Status:** design approved 2026-07-12 (grilled decision-by-decision). **M0 grilled and
recorded 2026-07-12** (see [ADR-011](adr/011-alembic-migrations-plain-sql-no-orm.md),
[ADR-012](adr/012-m0-implementation-stack.md)). **M0 / M0b ACCEPT COMPLETE 2026-07-12** —
the code monorepo `../second-brain/` is **deployed live at `https://braindan.cc`**: PWA over
HTTPS, login works, `/health` green (db/vault/git_remote), Cloudflare TLS **Full (strict)**,
`claude login` done on the box. The one accept clause with no M0 surface — the *live*
Claude-limit→Nebius chain-and-record — is formally **deferred to M3** (satisfied for M0 by
unit tests); see [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md) Accept amendment.
**M1 grilled + recorded to build-ready detail 2026-07-12** (see
[ADR-019](adr/019-conversational-capture-minimal-in-m1.md) and the M1 build-decisions block in
[08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md)) — minimal conversational capture pulled
into M1, full ADR-014 durability set, online-only web capture. **M1 implementation IN PROGRESS:
Task 1 (migration 002 + capture domain core / `CapturePipeline`), Task 2 (capture routers +
lifespan wiring), Task 3 / durability **Slice A** (git-backed `VaultBackupService` — one-lock
ff-only push + heal-on-reject merge, debounced commits, empty-repo bootstrap, gc/reflog pins,
`POST /admin/backup`), and durability **Slice B1** (the four R2/WORM jobs — `git bundle`→R2 +
fingerprint, integrity drill, `pg_dump`→R2, `/srv/data`→R2 — `agent_runs` writer, boto3 object
store, CLI) done, reviewed, and verified 2026-07-12** (see the *M1 progress* block in
[08](08-implementation-plan.md)). **Next: durability Slice B2** — wire the in-process APScheduler +
add the `/health` 4th leg — then the web capture screen. Code committed locally (not pushed —
user's call). Paused per the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md).

> **Planning/replanning sessions start with `/grilling`; implementation sessions build
> against the approved plan (no grilling). Every session follows
> [09-session-protocol.md](09-session-protocol.md).**

## Development workspace layout (local machine)

```
PersonalSecondBrain/          # workspace folder, not a repo

Production vault lives on the VPS (see [ADR-001](adr/001-vault-on-vps-with-git-backup.md)).

## Cold start — instructions for a fresh implementation session

If you are an AI (or human) picking this up with no prior context:

0. Follow the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md): **planning/replanning** sessions
   `/grilling` first, record decisions to docs, and **pause before implementation** so the
   user can continue or respawn; **implementation** sessions build against the approved plan
   (no grilling), pausing between tasks. Commit + push docs at every pause.
1. Read the docs in the order above; skim every ADR — they are binding.
2. The code monorepo `../second-brain/` **may not exist yet**. If missing, create it per
   [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) layout (`server/`, `web/`, `deploy/`), git-init
   it, and copy [templates/CLAUDE.md](templates/CLAUDE.md) to its root as `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Implement strictly by phases in [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md),
   starting at the first milestone whose acceptance criteria don't pass yet. Do not skip ahead.
4. Anything ambiguous or contradictory: fix the docs first (new ADR if architectural),
   then implement. Never silently diverge from these documents.
5. Things intentionally NOT decided yet (ask the user when reached): domain name,
   Cloudflare account setup, Supabase project credentials, Slack app creation,
   GitHub repo names for vault backup and code.

## Rules of this repo

- Behavior changes in code **must** be reflected here first or alongside — docs are the contract.
- New architectural choices get a new ADR; existing ADRs are never edited, only superseded.
- Docs are written to be directly ingestible by an AI implementer (Claude Code).
