# Personal Second Brain — Documentation

This repository is the **single source of truth for product and architecture decisions**.
It lives outside the code on purpose: the code repo (`../second-brain/`) contains only
implementation plus a `CLAUDE.md` that points here.

## Current status (snapshot — 2026-07-19)

> This section is a **snapshot, updated in place** each session. The full session-by-session
> history lives in **[08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)** (append-only —
> a superseded snapshot entry moves there verbatim). The authoritative build state is
> **[08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md)** + **[08-logs/](08-logs/)**.

**Live at `https://braindan.cc` — M0 through M8.2 all closed.** The graph-native stack
([ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)–029 pivot, M3): capture
(voice/text/MCP) → organizer (single writer; typed nodes + edges, entity resolution, alias
accretion, diacritic folding) → `PSB-graph` git store → index/hybrid search (vector ⊍ FTS RRF +
recency + profile leg). Grounded cited **chat** with UI-editable model routing
(`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`; provider ≠ model, [ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md))
+ provider observability (M4). **MCP server behind self-hosted OAuth 2.1** — connector-verified
on Claude (mobile/web) *and* ChatGPT (M5); identity capsule L0. **Pipeline scheduling primitive**
(M5.5, [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md)). **Chat distiller** with stance gate,
watermarks, salience, dedup sweep + merge core, inbox drainer, one-tap remove (M6,
[ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md)/[049](adr/049-dedup-sweep-merge-core-build-decisions.md)).
**Map/Explore** constellation UI (M7/M8.1), **ops console + observability** (M8,
[ADR-053](adr/053-m8-ops-console-observability-build-decisions.md)), **graph-health**.
**Interiority + temporal correctness** (M8.2, [ADR-055](adr/055-interiority-inner-voice-first-class.md)/[056](adr/056-temporal-correctness-date-tokens.md)):
"LLMs classify, code computes" (hard rule 12), anchored symbolic time-refs → `[[t:…]]` tokens,
inner-voice extraction; prod reprocessed (41/41 captures, 160 nodes). Durability: everything
derived rebuilds from the store (`reprocess-all-from-raw`, vision P10,
[ADR-042](adr/042-reprocess-all-from-raw-and-data-survival.md)); reindex parity verified live.

**Where we are (2026-07-19):** **M9.6 T6 drill partially run — the composite core VERIFIED live;
two FAILs replanned into M9.7 (GRILLED TO BUILD-READY, [ADR-062](adr/062-chat-screenshot-self-attribution.md)).**
The `openRun` deploy went live first (`6786bb6`), then the user worked the
[drill](08-logs/m9.6-accept-drill.md): **§A all 7 + §B all 3 PASSED** (ordinals, blended organize,
**per-node attribution**, resume/discard — the first real multi-part composite in prod), §C.1/.3 +
§E.1/.3 passed; still to run: §A DB check, §D, §E.4–6, §F, §G. The two failures, root-caused in
code and grilled into **[08 §M9.7](08-implementation-plan.md)**:
- **§C.2 — no live "inner running bits"** on the run deep-link: `agent_runs.details` land only at
  finish, the pipeline emits no per-part progress lines, and RunDetail renders neither the existing
  `RunLogTail` nor a parts block. → **M9.7 C**: finish ADR-061 §10 *by reuse* — milestone
  `logger.info` lines (stream via the M8 run-log tail, zero new schema) + RunDetail renders the
  live tail + a structured `derive.parts[]` block.
- **§E.2 — own-chat screenshot misattribution**: the user's own conversation organized as "P1 + an
  unnamed *sender*" (the ADR-057 §5 / organizer-v7 "never you" rule is wrong for the own-chat
  case; no identity signal exists at ingest). → **ADR-062**: vision emits disciplined per-message
  lines (side + sender + reply-quote insets), organizer v8 maps right→the user's own words (no
  self-entity, phantom-sender ban), default own-chat; **A/B** `llama-4-scout-17b` vs
  `qwen2.5-vl-72b` before any routing change; **migration** = rederive+reorganize existing photos.
- **Scope add — general capture remove** (`DELETE /captures/{id}` + double-confirmed UI),
  reversing ADR-048 §11's "backlog": entirely deletes a capture (nodes, media files, everywhere-
  visibility; hubs preserved, tombstone replay-excluded) — needed for A/B hygiene and as product.

**Next:** implement **M9.7** (implementation session, no grilling): **Batch A {T1 vision format,
T2 pipeline logging, T3 RunDetail tail+parts}** → **Batch B {T4 organizer v8, T5 remove server,
T6 remove web}** → **T7 live Accept** (deploy; A/B on the real screenshot; migration rederive;
re-drill §C.2/§E.2 + the remaining drill steps; flip **M9.6 T6 + M9.7** done together).

> **Planning/replanning sessions start with `/grilling`; implementation sessions build
> against the approved plan (no grilling). Every session follows
> [09-session-protocol.md](09-session-protocol.md).**

The production graph store lives on the VPS ([ADR-001](adr/001-vault-on-vps-with-git-backup.md) +
[ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md)).

## Cold start — instructions for a fresh implementation session

If you are an AI (or human) picking this up with no prior context:

0. Follow the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md): **planning/replanning** sessions
   `/grilling` first, record decisions to docs, and **pause before implementation** so the
   user can continue or respawn; **implementation** sessions build against the approved plan
   (no grilling), pausing between tasks. Commit + push docs at every pause.
1. Read the docs in the order above; skim every ADR — they are binding.
2. The code monorepo lives at `../second-brain/` (server/, web/, deploy/, tools/;
   its `CLAUDE.md` carries the binding implementation rules).
3. Implement strictly by phases in [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md),
   starting at the first milestone whose acceptance criteria don't pass yet. Do not skip ahead.
4. Anything ambiguous or contradictory: fix the docs first (new ADR if architectural),
   then implement. Never silently diverge from these documents.
5. Things intentionally NOT decided yet (ask the user when reached): Slack app creation (M12);
   exact vision model ids (M9 T1 — verified against live Groq/Nebius catalogs at build).
   Already provisioned: domain (`braindan.cc`), Cloudflare, Supabase, code repo, `PSB-graph`
   (+ VPS deploy key, write access).
6. Update the **Current status** snapshot above **in place** at every pause; move the
   superseded entry verbatim to [08-logs/status-history.md](08-logs/status-history.md)
   (append-only). Never let state live only in chat.

## Rules of this repo

- Behavior changes in code **must** be reflected here first or alongside — docs are the contract.
- New architectural choices get a new ADR; existing ADRs are never edited, only superseded.
- Docs are written to be directly ingestible by an AI implementer (Claude Code).
- **This repo is public: no real names, no relationship details, no personal data** — use
  placeholders (P1/P2) in logs; the triage manifest and export data stay local, gitignored.
