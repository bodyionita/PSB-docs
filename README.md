# Personal Second Brain — Documentation

This repository is the **single source of truth for product and architecture decisions**.
It lives outside the code on purpose: the code repo (`../second-brain/`) contains only
implementation plus a `CLAUDE.md` that points here.

**Status (2026-07-13).** **THE MIND-GRAPH PIVOT approved (2026-07-13, grilled decision-by-decision)**
— the vision is reframed as a **typed mind graph**: Obsidian removed entirely, the note vault
becomes a **graph store** of typed nodes (`memory`/`person`/`idea`/`conversation`/`insight`) with
typed edges, governed vocabulary growth, MCP as a peer surface (query + store), conversational
ingestion with a stance gate + review queue, a visual map, and an ops-console/observability
contract — **[ADR-026](adr/026-graph-native-storage-obsidian-removed.md) ·
[027](adr/027-typed-vocabulary-governance.md) · [028](adr/028-one-service-layer-mcp-peer-surface.md) ·
[029](adr/029-conversational-ingestion-stance-gate-review-queue.md)**; new roadmap **M3–M11** in
[08](08-implementation-plan.md). **M0 / M1 / M2 ACCEPT COMPLETE** on the pre-pivot note model —
deployed live at `https://braindan.cc` (capture → organize → index/search, full ADR-014
durability); that system stays live until M3 lands (fresh start: the old vault is archived, no
data migration). The previously grilled chat plan ([ADR-025](adr/025-ui-editable-model-routing-and-per-task-effort.md))
is carried intact to **M4**, retargeted to nodes.
**ADR-033 (2026-07-13): `obsidian-second-brain` review adopted in full** — identity capsule,
contradiction sweep, freshness stamps + staleness interviews, reflection enrichments (emerge
taxonomy/challenge/belief timeline), graph-health, research-via-MCP pattern, **Telegram capture
promoted into M9** (pull-forward eligible); storage-model ideas explicitly rejected (safeguarded
in the ADR). **ADR-034: round-2 repo review** — **evidence-tiered profiles** (stub/snapshot/full
by graph degree) into the M3 profile job; ecosystem references saved; the rest skipped.
**Prior-art research pass adopted in full (2026-07-13, [ADR-032](adr/032-prior-art-adoptions.md))** —
field survey validated the design (several areas ahead of SOTA); adoptions: edge `until`,
exact-alias short-circuit, observation-style profiles, day/night effort, RRF hybrid retrieval +
guards, MCP pagination/`build_context`, plus M6/M7/backlog refinements and explicit rejections.
**M3 GRILLED TO BUILD-READY (2026-07-13 — [ADR-030](adr/030-entity-substrate-and-lifecycle.md)/[031](adr/031-m3-organizer-and-contract-extensions.md)):**
sync-full organize + MCP burst queue; alias/disambig entity substrate with bounded resolution;
kind-generic review queue in M3; thin hubs + derived profiles; merge/backfill; `occurred`;
9 types / 6 edge rels; edge `{conf,since}` + `organizer_version`; injection hygiene; repo
**`PSB-graph`** with a zero-manual-VPS cutover. M4/M6 addenda ratified (re-check at kickoff).
**M3 in progress: tasks 1–6 done** (2026-07-13/14; tasks 2/3/5 combined by user call — store writer +
rename + bootstrap, organizer v3 + entity resolution, indexer/search retarget). Task 6 (2026-07-14):
**entity services** — `POST /admin/entities/merge` (propose→apply: retarget inbound edges → union
aliases → `merged_into` tombstone → reindex → force-commit), a nightly **backfill** scan (qualifying-
alias auto-link of recent memories, watermark-bounded) and a nightly **profile-refresh** (derived
entity profiles **tiered by graph degree** — stub/snapshot/full, ADR-034 — into a new `node_profiles`
table, served by `GET /nodes/{id}`); migration 006. 294 tests green, independent review clean (3
minors fixed) — [08-logs/m3.md](08-logs/m3.md).
**Task 7a done (2026-07-14):** vocabulary governance core — `PgVocabularyStore` over `app_settings`,
an `EffectiveVocabulary` provider (config seeds ∪ approved additions) threaded into every writer so an
approved type is **forward-live**, `GET /types`, `PUT /settings/vocabulary`, the vocab-proposal branch
delegated to one `VocabularyService` (shared with `POST /review/{id}`), and a feed-visible
`vocab-consolidation` run on approve (replaces task 4's SKIPPED marker). Scope split by
**[ADR-035](adr/035-vocabulary-consolidation-scope-m3.md)** (edges apply / nodes propose-only). 318
tests green (+24), ruff clean, **independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (2 minors fixed) —
[08-logs/m3.md](08-logs/m3.md) task 7a; commits `dd3c5be`/`410b5d2`.
**Task 7b done (2026-07-14):** edge retro-consolidation apply — `POST /admin/vocab/consolidate`, an
on-demand two-step (ADR-024 shape) that **re-types existing edges** onto a newly-approved rel:
`NodeWriter.retype_edge` (rel-only frontmatter rewrite, `conf`/`since`/`until` preserved, field-boundary
match, dedup-safe), a bounded recency-ordered edge inventory (`PgEdgeConsolidationStore`), and a
`vocab-consolidation` background apply (rewrite → reindex → force-commit, skip-and-continue). Scope
pinned by **[ADR-036](adr/036-edge-retro-consolidation-walk-retypings-only-m3.md)** (re-typings only;
new-edge invention + node re-typing deferred; reconciles the ADR-035 §2 / 04-pipelines wording split).
344 tests (+26), ruff clean, **independent review APPROVE after fixes** (1 must-fix prefix-colliding-rel
+ 3 minors, all resolved + regression-tested); commit `542459d`.
**Task 8 done (2026-07-14):** web retarget — the PWA moved note→node across all five surfaces
against the M3 API (03-api §Search & graph/§Review/§Settings): `SearchResultItem`/`NodeDetailResponse`
+ `getNode`/`types`/`review`/`vocabulary` clients, a `ui/nodeTypes` icon map (governed-type fallback),
search **type icons** + type/plane filters, a node preview with the derived **profile** + canonical/
derived **edges**, capture strip **node_paths** chips, a new **Review** tab (entity-ambiguity picker +
vocab approve/reject), and **Settings → Vocabulary**. No server code touched (ADR-006). tsc/eslint/vite
green; a **real-browser walkthrough vs a throwaway mock API** drove all five surfaces (console clean);
**independent review APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no must-fix** (3 minors fixed) — [08-logs/m3.md](08-logs/m3.md)
task 8. Out of scope (M8/admin, endpoints exist but no web surface): edge-consolidation + entity-merge UIs.
**Task 9 done (2026-07-14):** deploy/CI retarget vault→graph store — `GRAPH_STORE_PATH=/srv/graph-store`
+ `GRAPH_STORE_REPO` in `defaults.env`/`.env.example`, `/srv/graph-store` mount + `graph_store_deploy_key`
bind in compose, matching `docker-entrypoint.sh`/`Dockerfile` (`safe.directory` — a functional miss)
/`provision.sh` (two-pass hardening guard intact), and a deploy-workflow step printing the VPS deploy
**public** key into the Actions log (best-effort; private key never leaves the box). App bootstrap still
owns remote-wire + `push -u` (ADR-031 §6); no VPS git steps. YAML + `sh -n` clean; **independent review
APPROVE — no must-fix** — [08-logs/m3.md](08-logs/m3.md) task 9; commit `e97671b`.
**Task 10 in progress (2026-07-14): live M3 Accept.** Green baseline (344 tests) + carried backend
smokes closed against **real local pgvector**: migration 006 applied; a real-DB SQL smoke
(`server/scripts/smoke_db.py`) drives the actual task-6/7a/7b `Pg*` stores — **23/23 green**. The
smoke surfaced a real gap → replanned: **`profile-embedding-in-search` was an unbuilt
[ADR-030](adr/030-entity-substrate-and-lifecycle.md) §4 requirement** (search was chunks-only; the
stored profile vector never queried). Mechanism pinned by **[ADR-037](adr/037-profile-embedding-in-search-m3.md)**
— a second per-profile vector leg unioned best-per-node with the chunk leg (all tiers, no weighting,
`SearchResultItem` unchanged, reindex-decoupled); **migration 007** adds the profile HNSW index.
**Built + independently reviewed (APPROVE, no must-fix)** — commits `d0fc52e`/`8ec472a`; 344 tests +
26-check real-DB smoke green, ruff clean. Alias *accretion* stays a documented follow-up (the exact
short-circuit serves "mentioned twice → one node"). **Live-Accept decision: go straight to prod** (no
local dry-run) — the remaining step is the **prod cutover**: a push to `main` auto-deploys (CI runs
`alembic upgrade head` on prod; migration 005 drops the pre-pivot note tables), then a joint live
Accept (capture→node→PSB-graph push < 30s, entity resolution, `inbox/` fallback, vocab consolidation,
DB-wipe/reindex parity, `ENTITY_MATCH_MIN_CONF` tuning) → user archives `PSB-vault`. Code committed
through `8ec472a`, **not pushed**.
**Cutover DONE + Accept STARTED then PAUSED to replan (2026-07-14).** Pushed `8ec472a`; CI green; prod
live on the graph schema (migrations 005/006/007; `/api/v1/health` all-green). Fixed a **deploy-key
gap** on the VPS (graph-store key was missing → per-capture pushes soft-failed; reused the freed
`vault_deploy_key`, force-recreated the api container → `PSB-graph` now populated). The 4 live captures
then surfaced **organizer-quality defects** — 🔴 dangling edges (reorganize deletes shared entity
hubs), person over-extraction, entity split (Horia/Horia Fenwick), diacritic mangling; `inbox/`
clarified as the model-failure-only fallback. User paused to **replan quality** and set a binding
principle: **already-ingested data must survive bug fixes** (reprocess raw, never silently drop) —
lifted to **vision P10**. Grilled decision-by-decision → **[ADR-038](adr/038-reorganize-preserves-shared-entity-hubs.md)**
(hubs shared, never deleted by reorganize) · **[039](adr/039-entity-types-are-mention-only.md)** (entity
types mention-only + coercion guard) · **[040](adr/040-token-overlap-retrieval-and-alias-accretion.md)**
(token-overlap retrieval + alias accretion) · **[041](adr/041-diacritic-folding-derived-content.md)**
(fold diacritics on all derived content, raw kept) · **[042](adr/042-reprocess-all-from-raw-and-data-survival.md)**
(reusable `reprocess-all-from-raw` op + the data-survival principle). New **task 11** in [08](08-implementation-plan.md)
(all must-fix; build → review → local-test the reprocess → deploy + reprocess prod → finish the
remaining Accept criteria → archive `PSB-vault`). Code pushed through `8ec472a`; **no new code this
session** (planning pass — paused before implementing task 11).
**Task 11 DONE + M3 Accept criteria ALL GREEN (2026-07-14).** Built/reviewed/deployed/prod-reprocessed
(through `f8a0e1b`); then the four remaining task-10 Accept criteria verified live (no code): **reindex
parity EXACT** (wipe → `/admin/reindex` rebuilt a byte-identical index from the `PSB-graph` store —
Rule-1/ADR-001 durability), **profile-in-search** (ADR-037 — ran the VPS `profile-refresh` after finding
`node_profiles` empty post-reprocess; person hubs surface via the profile leg, confirmed in the PWA),
**vocab-proposal→consolidation** round-trip (edge-rel propose → approve → forward-live + feed-visible run,
synthetic seed reverted), **`ENTITY_MATCH_MIN_CONF` kept at 0.8** (conservative, zero false merges).
Follow-up logged: reprocess/reindex leave `node_profiles` empty until the nightly job. **`PSB-vault`
archived by the user (2026-07-14) → M3 CLOSED** — all acceptance criteria pass; the graph-native stack is
live at `braindan.cc` ([08-logs/m3.md](08-logs/m3.md) "Task 10/11").
**M4 (chat) GRILLED TO BUILD-READY (2026-07-14 — planning session, decision-by-decision).** Resolved to
a **lean spine + explicit deferrals**: build the chat loop + **hybrid vector+FTS RRF** retrieval
(migration 008, FTS mirrors the ADR-037 chunks⊍profiles union) + recency prior + `since`/`until`/simple
`as_of` + English condensation + **fenced** grounded prompt + cited-only `[n]`; **3 UI-editable routing
groups** (`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`) with all 6 conspect call-sites rewired + per-call effort; new
**[ADR-043](adr/043-quick-routing-tier-m4.md)** adds the **`quick` tier** (Sonnet-4.6-low / Nebius) for
trivial tasks (M4's only caller = LLM session titling). **Deferred:** graph-aware expansion (1-hop
injection + entity-seeded) → backlog, **identity capsule → M5** (build_context owns it), challenge mode →
backlog. Doc reconciliations recorded (08 M4 kickoff note + task list; 04-pipelines condensation-effort +
retrieval; 03/02/06 for 3 groups + migration 008). **Paused before implementation** per
[09](09-session-protocol.md) — 8 M4 tasks open in [08](08-implementation-plan.md). **No code this session.**
**M4 task 1 DONE (2026-07-14):** model routing engine — `ModelRoutingService` over the 3 groups
(`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`, [ADR-043](adr/043-quick-routing-tier-m4.md)) reading config seeds overlaid
with `app_settings.model_routing` (cache-bust on save, rule-7 degrade to seed); **per-call effort** through
the provider boundary (`claude-max` honors `--effort`, Nebius ignores); a distinct **`claude-max-sonnet`**
provider id (same CLI, config model, `quick` seed = sonnet@low / nebius); and **all 6 `conspect` call sites
rewired** through the service (organize, nudge, entity resolution, profile gen, tag + edge consolidation).
No migration (routing is `app_settings` jsonb). ruff clean, **396 tests green** (+25); **independent review
APPROVE — no must-fix** (3 minors fixed) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 1. **Code committed locally,
not pushed.** Next: M4 task 2 (retrieval — migration 008 + hybrid RRF).
**M4 task 2 DONE (2026-07-14):** retrieval — **migration 008** (a generated `tsvector` on `chunks` **and**
`node_profiles` + GIN, mirroring the ADR-037 vector union) and a rewritten hybrid `search_chunks`:
vector (cosine) ⊍ FTS (`websearch_to_tsquery('english', …)`) legs, each best-per-node + candidate-pool-
bounded, fused by **RRF** (rank-based, `k=60` — never blends cosine with `ts_rank`, [ADR-032](adr/032-prior-art-adoptions.md)
§5), then a **mild recency prior** (bounded `[floor,1]` multiplicative on `occurred ?? created`, §7). The FTS
leg **self-suppresses** on non-English / zero-lexeme queries (no language-detect dep). New temporal filters on
`/search`: `since`/`until` occurred-window + simple node-date `as_of`. Config knobs (`rrf_k`/`candidates`/
`recency_*`, Rule-9); `SearchResultItem` shape unchanged. ruff clean, **400 tests green** (+4) + **12 new
real-PG16 smoke checks** (hybrid SQL isn't fake-testable); **independent review APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no
must-fix** (3 minors fixed: half-life div-by-zero guard, UTC-pinned recency date, deterministic rank tiebreak;
1 logged for task 3 — tune the chat `min_score` floor to the RRF scale) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 2.
**Code committed locally, not pushed.** Next: M4 task 3 (chat service).
**M4 task 3 DONE (2026-07-14):** chat service (service layer only; routers = task 4) — new `app/chat/`
package: `ChatService.send` **persists the user turn before any model call** (never-lose) → turn-1 raw /
**turn-≥2 English condensation on `conspect`** (degrade-to-raw when down) → **hybrid RRF retrieval** via the
existing `SearchService` → **fenced** grounded prompt (data-not-instructions) → **cited-only `[n]` renumber**
(`citations.py`, out-of-range dropped never-errors) → persist assistant turn (`model` incl. fallback +
`sources` jsonb, `PgChatStore`) → **best-effort non-blocking `quick`-tier titling** after the first exchange
(drained on shutdown). **MINOR-1 resolved:** the chat "not in your memories" floor (`chat_retrieval_min_score`
= 0.01) is floored on the **fused RRF×recency** scale, **not** cosine — `SearchService.search` gained a
keyword-only `min_score` override (default keeps `/search` unchanged). ruff clean, **423 tests green** (+23)
+ **7 real-PG chat-store smoke checks**; **independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (1 minor fixed —
`_clean_title` tests; 2 logged) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 3; commits `6406bd9`/`0559799`.
**Code committed locally, not pushed.** Next: M4 task 4 (chat routers).
**M4 task 4 DONE (2026-07-14):** chat routers (`app/routers/chat.py`, thin over the task-3 `ChatService`) —
**`POST /chat`** (`RegistryExhausted`→**503** with the user turn still persisted, `ChatSessionNotFound`→**404**;
picker/`planes`/`top_k` forwarded, `model_used`/`fallback_used` surfaced), **`GET /chat/models`** (a new
`ModelRoutingService.chat_catalog` over `registry.chat_models()`; `default` = the Chat group's active model),
**`GET /chat/sessions[/{id}]`** (read paths added to `ChatService`, bounded by a new `chat_sessions_list_limit`).
Added a provider **`can_chat`**+`label` seam (the OpenAI-compatible class also backs STT/embedding — so
`chat_models()` filters on real capability, not the `ChatProvider` class) and **boundary uuid validation** on
`session_id` (body + path → 422 on malformed, so the uuid column never 500s). ruff clean, **439 tests green**
(+16); **independent review APPROVE after fixes** — 2 must-fix (STT/embedding providers leaking into the picker;
malformed-session 500), **both resolved + regression-tested** — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 4; commit
`5059570`. **Code committed locally, not pushed.** Next: M4 task 5 (settings routers).
**M4 task 5 DONE (2026-07-14):** settings routers — **`GET /settings`** (all 3 routing groups `chat`/`conspect`/
`quick` with effective saved-over-seed routing + the registry's pickable models, each carrying `supports_effort`
+ **provider-sourced `effort_levels`** — no hardcoded lists in web) and **`PUT /settings/models`** (saves one
group, busts the routing cache **forward-live**; unknown active/fallback id, effort on a non-effort model, bad
level, or bad group → **422** before any `app_settings` write). Added a `ModelRoutingService.save_group`/
`all_settings` + `GroupSettings`/`UnknownModel`, a `ChatProvider.effort_levels` seam, and extended
`ChatModelOption` (defaulted, so `GET /chat/models` is unchanged). ruff clean, **449 tests green** (+12);
**independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (2 minors: flagged test edges added; a deliberate ADR-025-accepted
display-verbatim choice logged) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 5; commit `bb6857a`. **Code committed
locally, not pushed.** Next: M4 task 6 (web chat screen).
**M4 task 6 DONE (2026-07-14):** web chat screen — the PWA's Chat tab, a thin TanStack-Query client over the
task-4/5 API (03-api §Chat; no server code, ADR-006): implicit-session chat loop with **list/open/new** (a
`seededFor`-guarded one-time thread seed so a send's optimistic turns — incl. a just-created session — survive
the detail refetch), a composer with a **per-conversation model picker** (`GET /chat/models`, resets to the
Chat-group default per thread) + **plane chips** + auto-grow textarea + **Enter-to-send**, a **reduced-motion-
gated client-side reveal** (word+`[n]`-badge stagger, fresh turns only) whose citation clicks expand +
scroll to **cited-only source cards**, a **"not from your memories"** chip on empty `sources`, and an
**"answered by `<model>`"** banner on `fallback_used`. Titles land via a **bounded session-list poll**. Search's
node preview was extracted into a shared **`ui/NodePreview`** + **`ui/nodeDetail`** primitive so the chat source
cards reuse it (rule 10). tsc/eslint/vite green; a **real-browser walkthrough vs a throwaway mock API** drove
every surface (grounded/ungrounded, citation→preview expand, model switch, seeding, titling — console clean);
**independent review APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no must-fix** (2 fixed: citation-adjacent space drop, reduced-motion
on the thinking dots/entrances; 1 deferred — the sessions-list item carries no first-message text, a server-
contract follow-up) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 6; commits `fea9f9d`/`85be897`. **Code committed
locally, not pushed.** Next: M4 task 7 (web Settings → Models panel).
**M4 task 7 DONE (2026-07-14):** web Settings → Models panel — the PWA's Settings **Models** section, a thin
TanStack-Query client over the task-5 API (03-api §Settings; no server code, ADR-006), replacing the `ComingSoon`
placeholder: one card per **routing group** (`chat`/`conspect`/`quick`) with an **active** + **fallback** dropdown
(fallback carries a **None** = `""`) and a **segmented effort selector rendered only for the selected
effort-supporting models** in `{active, fallback}` — **all choices + effort levels registry-sourced** from
`GET /settings`, **nothing hardcoded** (ADR-006 / ADR-025 §6). Save `PUT`s **one group** with a **normalized**
`effort_by_provider` (a valid level for exactly the effort-capable selected models, stale keys dropped → never a
server 422), is **dirty-gated**, and is **forward-live** (invalidates `['settings']` **and** `['chat','models']`
so the composer default follows); a `signature`-ref re-seed applies server changes without clobbering in-progress
edits. tsc/eslint/vite green; a **real-browser walkthrough vs a throwaway mock API** drove every surface (3 groups
seed-correct, a second effort control on a dual-Claude group, a Chat@high save persisted + reflected forward-live,
a Nebius active dropping its effort control + saving an empty payload with a None fallback — console clean);
**independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (1 minor fixed: reduced-motion on the "Saved" slide; 1 deferred —
cosmetic "Saved" re-show on manual revert) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 7. **Code committed locally, not
pushed.** Next: M4 task 8 (live M4 Accept).
**M4 task 8 DONE → M4 (chat) ACCEPT COMPLETE (2026-07-14).** Pushed the 9 M4 commits to prod (CI green, migration
008 applied, `/api/v1/health` all-true) and ran the live Accept at `braindan.cc`: grounded `[n]`-cited chat on
**both Claude** (`claude-opus-4-8`, 4 source cards) **and Nebius**, "not in your memories" on ungrounded questions,
sessions persist with LLM titles, **clause (A)** Settings-driven **Nebius-primary drive recorded** on
`chat_messages.model=nebius` (verified via authenticated API — the mobile PWA's bottom-nav tap was flaky), **clause
(B)** true fallback shown live, 21 registry tests green. A **local in-process dry-run** (real app + local pgvector,
auth gate overridden) preceded the push and verified the Claude leg, persistence, not-in-memories, fallback
mechanism, and 503-on-exhaustion — no code defects. The prod Accept **surfaced + fixed a real config defect**: the
committed `NEBIUS_CHAT_MODEL` was `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` — a HuggingFace-style id **Nebius never
served** (it uses `Llama-3.1-...`, since retired for **Llama 3.3**), so **every** live Nebius call silently fell
back to claude-max (never caught pre-M4: M0/M3 made no live Nebius call, the 21 tests use fakes). Corrected to
**`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`** in all four committed spots (commit `419ece4`), redeployed, and re-verified
Nebius answers grounded + recorded. Prod Chat routing restored to the seed default (Claude/opus primary, Nebius
fallback). Grounded cited chat over the graph is **live at `braindan.cc`** — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) task 8.
**Follow-ups (out of M4):** UI "Claude Max"→"Claude"+effort-label relabel (needs a planning pass); optional
provider-observability surface (a provider silently fell back with no visible reason — rule 7 / vision P8).
**Code pushed through `419ece4`.** Next: **M5 (MCP server)** — planning session (`/grilling` first).
**M4 follow-up 1 (relabel) DONE (2026-07-15):** friendly model names ("Claude Opus 4.8"/"Claude Sonnet 4.6"/
"Llama 3.3 70B") + effort labels on the chat picker + per-message "answered by" caption; server-derived labels
(rule 9), 460 tests green, independent review APPROVE, **pushed to prod** (`ba07eb7`/`753eff5`) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md).
**M4 follow-up 2 (provider observability) GRILLED TO BUILD-READY (2026-07-15 — [ADR-044](adr/044-provider-observability-surface.md)):**
in-memory per-provider status on the registry (no migration; sticky `last_error` + `last_success_at` +
`consecutive_failures`, recorded at chat/STT/embedding call sites) behind a session-gated **`GET /admin/providers`**
(live `Provider.health()` reachability probe — *not* a success guarantee; `/health` untouched) + a read-only
Settings **Providers** card. Closes the P8/rule-7 silent-fallback gap. **2 tasks** open in [08 §M4 follow-up](08-implementation-plan.md)
(server; web + live Accept). **Paused before implementation — no code this session.** Next: build task 1, or **M5** planning.
**M4 follow-up 2 · Task 1 (server) DONE (2026-07-15):** in-memory `ProviderStatusTracker` on the registry
(sticky `last_error` + `last_success_at` + `consecutive_failures`, injectable clock) wired at **all three**
call sites — chat, STT, and the previously-unrecorded no-fallback **embedding** leg (ADR-044's key blind
spot; records then re-raises, nothing swallowed) — plus session-gated **`GET /admin/providers`** (live
concurrent `health()` probe, defensive against a raising probe) with `capabilities` derived from
configuration (`can_chat`/`can_transcribe`/`can_embed`), not the class hierarchy. `/health` untouched, no
migration. 476 tests green (+16), ruff clean, **independent review APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no must-fix** (the
one worthwhile minor, an HTTP-level endpoint test, was added) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md). **Code
committed locally (`9dad941`), not pushed.** Next: **Task 2** (web Providers card + live Accept), or **M5** planning.
**M4 follow-up 2 · Task 2 (web) DONE + mock-verified; live prod Accept pending a prod push (2026-07-15):**
read-only Settings **Providers** card — a thin TanStack read (`useProviders`, 15s poll) over `GET /admin/providers`
with a status dot (green `consecutive_failures == 0` / amber `> 0`), the sticky `last_error` line (muted once
recovered), capability chips, an "unreachable" tag, and last-success time; wire types exact-match the server
Pydantic models; `relativeTime` hoisted to a shared `ui/` helper. No server code (ADR-006). tsc/eslint/build
green; a **real-browser walkthrough vs a throwaway mock API** drove every render state **and a forced-failure→
recovery transition** (amber→green, failures cleared, `last_error` stays sticky+muted). **Independent review
APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no must-fix** (3 minors all fixed). Commit `a82500b`. **DEPLOYED to prod + live Accept VERIFIED
→ Task 2 DONE → M4 follow-up 2 (provider observability) COMPLETE (2026-07-15):** pushed `9dad941` + `a82500b`
(CI run `29390674935` all green); the real `braindan.cc` Settings → **Providers** card (read in the browser pane
against the live endpoint, existing prod session — agent never handled the login secret) **enumerates all 6
registered providers read-only** (claude-max/-sonnet + nebius = Chat, openai/groq = Speech, ollama = Embedding),
green dots, config-derived capabilities, **0 interactive controls**; all "No successful call yet" (correct
post-redeploy zero-state). **Both M4 follow-ups now complete; graph-native chat + observability live at
`braindan.cc`** — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md).
**M4 follow-up 3 (provider/model/effort separation) GRILLED TO BUILD-READY (2026-07-15 — [ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md)):**
the code conflated **provider** with **model** (two fake `claude-max`/`claude-max-sonnet` ids over one
`claude` CLI → duplicate Providers-card rows + a `claude-max` id leaking into the UI). Grilled
decision-by-decision to make **provider/model/effort** first-class: the **routable unit is a model id**
(provider derived; Option A), a **model id = the raw vendor string**, `claude` collapses to **one provider
serving Opus+Sonnet** via per-call `--model`, concept fixed across all providers while the picker stays
**chat-only**, config uses **named scalars** (`CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL`/`CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL`/`CLAUDE_EFFORT`),
saved routing **migrated in place** (idempotent Alembic) while historical `chat_messages.model` is **left +
legacy-tolerated** (P10), `effort_by_provider`→**`effort_by_model`**, and the Providers card renders **one
row per provider** (friendly name, no raw id). **Supersedes** the routing-unit of [ADR-025](adr/025-ui-editable-model-routing-and-per-task-effort.md)
+ the `claude-max-sonnet` mechanism of [ADR-043](adr/043-quick-routing-tier-m4.md); **refines** [ADR-004](adr/004-provider-registry-claude-primary-nebius-fallback.md).
**5 tasks** open in [08 §M4 follow-up 3](08-implementation-plan.md) (server core · migration · server API ·
web · live Accept). **Paused before implementation** per [09](09-session-protocol.md) — **no code this session.**
Next: build task 1 (server core), or **M5 (MCP server)** planning (`/grilling` first).
**M4 follow-up 3 · Task 1 (server core) DONE (2026-07-15):** the internal provider ≠ model engine — the two fake
single-model provider ids that shared the one `claude` CLI collapse into **one `claude` provider serving Opus +
Sonnet** via per-call `--model`; the routable unit is now a **model id** (raw vendor string, provider derived).
Config named scalars (`CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL`/`CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL`/`CLAUDE_EFFORT`) + model-string seed chains;
`ClaudeMaxProvider`→**`ClaudeProvider`** (`claude_max.py`→`claude.py`); registry gains a chat-model **catalog** +
**model→provider index** (routes by model id, runtime status keyed by **provider id** — a within-`claude` fallback
is one provider event, ADR-045 §6); **`effort_by_provider`→`effort_by_model`** through the service, jsonb, and wire;
`build_registry` = **5 providers**. Model labels are derived per model id (`labels.py`, rule 9); a new
`provider_label` carries the friendly provider name for the Providers card. **Deliberate behavior change (ADR-045
§5):** the `quick` group's effort seed is now `claude_effort` (medium), not the old per-tier low — the tier's
cheapness comes from the Sonnet **model** now; retunable in Settings. 478 tests green (+ conftest that isolates the
Claude Code shell's colliding `CLAUDE_EFFORT`; no prod risk), ruff clean, **independent review APPROVE — no
must-fix** ([08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) "follow-up 3 · Task 1"); commit `7c69449`, **not pushed**. **⚠ Do not
deploy before task 2 (migration)** — pre-existing saved `model_routing` would degrade to seed until it lands.
Next: **Task 2** (idempotent Alembic migration of saved routing + legacy-tolerant `chat_messages.model` labels).
**M4 follow-up 3 · Task 2 DONE (2026-07-15):** the P10-load-bearing migration — **Alembic revision 009**, an
idempotent plain-SQL data migration ([ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md) §4) that rewrites the
saved `app_settings.model_routing` row from old provider ids to model-id vendor strings (`claude-max`→
`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-max-sonnet`→`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `nebius`→`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`) in
active/fallback + the effort object's keys **plus the `effort_by_provider`→`effort_by_model` key rename** — an
ordered text-substitution over a closed token set (the `-sonnet` prefix hazard handled), no-op on absent/empty/
already-migrated rows, downgrade reverses it. Legacy-tolerant `friendly_model_label` folds the retired ids to their
vendor string so historical `chat_messages.model` rows (**left untouched** — rewriting audit would falsify it) still
render a friendly name. 481 tests + ruff green; the un-fakeable migration SQL **verified against a throwaway
Postgres 16** (remap, key rename, idempotency, downgrade round-trip, empty/absent no-op, key-scoping); **independent
review APPROVE — no must-fix** (2 minors applied) — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) "follow-up 3 · Task 2"; commits
`6133296`/`74de20d`, **not pushed**. The task-1 deploy-ordering guard is now satisfiable (deploy is still **task 5**,
after task 3 API + task 4 web). Next: **Task 3** (server API response shapes — `/settings`, `/chat/models`,
`/admin/providers`: model-id semantics, `effort_by_model`, provider-name label, provider-only rows).
**M4 follow-up 3 · Task 3 DONE (2026-07-15):** server API response shapes — comparing all three endpoints' wire
against the binding [03-api](03-api.md) contract, tasks 1/2 had already landed model-id semantics, `effort_by_model`,
the friendly `provider_label`, and the 5-provider collapse, leaving **one genuine gap**: `GET /settings` model
options didn't carry the contract-required `provider` (03-api §Settings). Added **`provider` to `RoutingModelItem`**,
sourced from the registry catalog (the *serving* provider id, derived — [ADR-045](adr/045-provider-model-effort-separation.md)
§1; both Claude models → one `claude`). `/chat/models` (`{id,label,effort}`, line 52) and `/admin/providers` (one
provider-labelled row, line 107) were **verified against the contract as already-correct — no change** ("no raw id"
is qualified as *in the UI*, so dropping the card's id is task 4). 481 tests + ruff green; **independent review
APPROVE — no must-fix** (reviewer re-derived scope from 03-api+ADR-045, confirmed the two no-change endpoints) —
[08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) "follow-up 3 · Task 3"; commit `a28ab04`, **not pushed**. Next: **Task 4** (web —
types, ModelsPanel model-id picks, chat composer picker, ProvidersPanel provider-only/drop id).
**M4 follow-up 3 · Task 4 DONE (2026-07-15):** the web half of ADR-045 (4 PWA files, no server code) — wire types
renamed `effort_by_provider`→**`effort_by_model`** (`GroupRoutingModel`/`ModelRoutingUpdate`) + **`provider` added to
`RoutingModelItem`** (03-api §Settings), exact-matching the task-1/3 server Pydantic; **`ModelsPanel`** reads/seeds/
dirty-tracks/PUTs `effort_by_model` (the dropdowns were already model-id-valued with server-friendly labels, so no raw
id shows); **`ProvidersPanel`** **drops the rendered raw provider id** (friendly name only, one row per provider —
ADR-045 §6 "no raw id in the UI"; `id` kept as the React key); the **chat composer picker** is unchanged under the
label-only `{id,label,effort}` contract (only a stale comment refreshed). tsc/eslint/vite green; a **real-browser
walkthrough vs a throwaway mock API** drove all three surfaces — Models seeds `effort_by_model` + a save round-trips it,
Providers renders the **5 friendly rows** (one "Claude") with **no id**, the composer shows model-id options with
friendly labels and its default follows the saved Chat routing **forward-live** (console clean); **independent review
APPROVE — no must-fix**. Commit `fc193c0`, **not pushed**. Next: **Task 5** (live M4 follow-up 3 Accept — deploy the
5 commits `7c69449`→`fc193c0`; migration 009 applies; saved routing preserved; card shows 5 rows / one "Claude"; chat
still grounded → independent review → pause).
**M4 follow-up 3 · Task 5 DONE → M4 follow-up 3 (provider/model/effort separation) COMPLETE (2026-07-15).**
Pushed the 5 commits `7c69449`→`fc193c0`; CI run `29397900778` all green; **migration 009 applied** on prod
(`alembic upgrade head` under `set -e`); `/api/v1/health` all-true. All Accept criteria met — the registry exposes
**5 providers with one `claude`** serving Opus+Sonnet, the **Providers card shows one "Claude" row** (no raw id),
Settings → Models picks **model ids** with `effort_by_model`, saved `model_routing` was **migrated in place** (not
silently reset — prefix hazard handled), chat stays **grounded + cited on Opus/Sonnet/Llama**, and **no `claude-max`/
`claude_max` string remains** in code/config/UI except the deliberate legacy-fold map + migration test input. Live
PWA surfaces user-confirmed against the existing prod session (agent never handled the login secret); **independent
review APPROVE — no must-fix** (a fresh agent re-derived all 8 criteria from ADR-045 + 03-api and checked the
`a82500b..fc193c0` diff). Provider is now first-class and distinct from model; grounded chat + provider observability
live at `braindan.cc` — [08-logs/m4.md](08-logs/m4.md) "follow-up 3 · Task 5". **Code pushed through `fc193c0`.**
**M5 (MCP server) GRILLED TO BUILD-READY (2026-07-15 — [ADR-046](adr/046-m5-mcp-server-oauth-connectors.md), decision-by-decision).**
The "smallest milestone" grew a real spine: the connection surfaces the user wants — **mobile Claude app + claude.ai web
(custom connectors)** — require an **OAuth 2.1 flow**, not a static bearer, so M5 stands up a **self-hosted OAuth 2.1
authorization server** (`authlib`: `.well-known` discovery, open DCR, `/authorize` password+consent gate w/ PKCE, opaque
HMAC-hashed DB tokens ~1h + long-lived sliding refresh, **revoke-all**, single scope) — the same build unlocks Claude
Desktop + ChatGPT (Claude Code CLI deferred). Remote **`mcp` SDK Streamable HTTP under `/mcp`** on the existing `api`
container, single origin (Caddy root routes, Cloudflare un-cached). Tools are **thin over the service layer, markdown-rendered**
(IDs verbatim, cross-model; hub edge cap + `traverse` pointer): `search`/`get_node`/`traverse` (new `GraphService.neighbors`
one-hop primitive, cursor-paginated — M7 reuses it)/`build_context` (depth ≤ 2, **identity capsule L0**)/`list_planes|types`/
`capture` (`source: mcp`, burst-queued, fast ack). Plus an `initialize` **`instructions`** usage capsule + tool descriptions
+ annotations + a **research-via-MCP Prompt** (ADR-033 #6). The **identity capsule** (ADR-033 #1, refined — insights barely
exist at M5): broadened source (hubs + recent memories + insights), **300-token** nightly distill → `app_settings` blob,
served as `build_context` L0 + `identity://me` **and wired into the M4 chat system prompt in M5**. **Resolves the old "MCP
token distribution" open question** (it's the add-connector OAuth flow). Accept gate = a **real Claude connector** live
(revoke-all locks it out); **ChatGPT fast-follow before M6**. **6 tasks** open in [08 §M5](08-implementation-plan.md).
**Paused before implementation** per [09](09-session-protocol.md) — **no code this session.** Next: build **M5 task 1**
(traverse primitive + `build_context` core), or respawn.
**M5 task 1 DONE (2026-07-15):** the graph read side — `PgNeighborStore.neighbors` (one-hop, both-dir union, rel/direction
filters, **keyset pagination** on `(origin,rel,dir,node_id)`, tombstoned endpoints excluded both ends) + `GraphService`
`neighbors` (opaque base64 cursor, limit-clamped, `InvalidDirection`/`InvalidCursor`) and `build_context` (get_node via a
`NodeReader` seam over search + a bounded neighbor tree: **depth ≤2** = 03-api contract, per-node **fanout cap** + `truncated`
flag, path **cycle guard**; **L0 identity capsule deferred to task 2**). Thin over the `edges` table, no LLM call; shared by
MCP `traverse`/`build_context` (task 4) + the M7 map. Config knobs (rule 9), wired into `app.state` + a `get_graph_service`
dep. **499 tests green** (+16 unit) + real-PG edge-SQL smoke (un-fakeable union/keyset/tombstone; needs local pgvector up —
pre-push gate), ruff clean; **independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (3 of 6 minors fixed) — [08-logs/m5.md](08-logs/m5.md).
Commits `ff4a729`/`bb33ae7`, **not pushed.** Next: **M5 task 2** (identity capsule distiller → `build_context` L0 + `identity://me` + wire into the M4 chat system prompt).
**M5 task 2 DONE (2026-07-15):** identity capsule — new `app/identity/` package: `PgCapsuleSourceStore`
(top profile hubs by canonical graph degree + recent memories + recent insights, tombstone-excluded) +
`PgIdentityCapsuleStore` (`{text, generated_at, source_refs}` blob in `app_settings`, no migration, rule-1
rebuildable) + `IdentityCapsuleService` — one `conspect` distill of the **fenced** blended source into a
~300-token capsule; **best-effort (rule 7)** (no source / LLM down / empty **keeps the last capsule**);
**single-flight** nightly job **04:35** (after profile-refresh/backfill) + on-demand **`POST
/admin/identity-capsule/refresh`** (`202`/`409`) + CLI, each wrapped in `agent_runs`. Served as
`build_context` **L0** (cheap `IdentityCapsuleReader` seam, never distilled inline, best-effort) **and**
prepended to the M4 chat system prompt (fenced data-not-instructions) — in-app chat finally consumes it.
The `identity://me` MCP resource stays task 4. Config knobs (rule 9). Also **closed the task-1 pre-push
gate** (real local pgvector; fixed two smoke-harness fragilities — Windows UTF-8 + global-read isolation,
`8afbb25`). **524 unit tests green + smoke 63/63** (5 new real-PG capsule checks), ruff clean; **independent

op-state). **authlib supplies only the security-critical crypto** (PKCE S256, secure token gen, RFC-8414

Opaque HMAC-hashed codes+tokens; **atomic single-use** codes with replay-revoke; **refresh rotation** with

a real Claude connector connects (a live 421-on-connect bug — FastMCP DNS-rebind allowed only localhost — was
fixed in `1ed0ee0`) and **`search` is verified grounded over the graph**. The **OAuth-focused independent

**M6 GRILLED TO BUILD-READY + a scheduling milestone carved out (2026-07-16 — planning session,
decision-by-decision).** Scope resolved to **core + addendum (a)–(d); (e) contradiction sweep
deferred**. The grill surfaced a scheduling-architecture change and an important durability seam,
both recorded:
**(1) [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md) — the pipeline is the scheduling
primitive.** Per-job staggered nightly crons (fragile when a step overruns; the reason for
RAM-stagger) are replaced by **pipelines** = one cron + an ordered list of steps run
**sequentially on completion**, per-step `on_fail` (`continue`|`halt`), parent+child `agent_runs`
(`parent_run_id`). Cadence → its own pipeline (`nightly`/`weekly`); a bare job is never scheduled,
even single-step work is a pipeline. Built as a small **M5.5** milestone (orchestration-only, all
existing jobs migrated) **before** M6's features, so a scheduling regression can't look like a
distiller bug. Supersedes ADR-010's stagger (the window stands).
**(2) [ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md) — M6 build decisions.** The load-bearing
call: an **endorsed chat memory materializes a `captures` row** (`source=chat`) → organizer, so it's
**replayed by `reprocess-all` ⇒ vision P10 holds** with zero chat-specific reprocess machinery.
Plus: single-pass multi-candidate distill on `conspect` (segmentation emergent, hedge/affect→review);
a per-session `chat_distill_state` **watermark** (idle-eligibility + idempotent delta re-distill);
**kind-aware reprocess** (preserve `stance-candidate`, truncate the rest); `maybe` **re-openable**;
coarse-LLM **salience** triage + **batch** actions + weekly **maybe digest**; a nightly all-source
**dedup sweep** (merge via an **extracted merge-core** shared with entity-merge; keep/link; augment
deferred); a nightly **inbox drainer**; **one-tap remove** = git-rm + DB-delete + **capture
tombstone** (`removed_at`, no resurrection); `remember` = sync distill / async organize; web Review
extensions + Chat "Remember now" + a chat-scoped "recently auto-recorded" list. Docs updated
(02/03/04/06/08 + ADR-047/048; the ratified M6 addendum marked resolved — `augment` + graph-degree
salience overridden for the M6 context). **Paused before implementation** per [09](09-session-protocol.md)
— **no code this session.** Next: build **M5.5 task 1** (pipeline runner), or respawn.
**M5.5 task 1 DONE (2026-07-16):** the pipeline scheduling primitive's **orchestration mechanism** —
runner + config model + `agent_runs.parent_run_id` — built against [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md),
**deliberately not wired into the scheduler and no job migrated** (task 2). **Migration 012**
(`agent_runs.parent_run_id`, nullable self-ref FK `ON DELETE SET NULL` + index — a bare job run stays
parentless, unchanged); **parent/child linkage via a task-local contextvar** (`child_run_scope`) so a
step's `run_scheduled` links to the pipeline parent with **no change to what any job does** (ADR-047
§5); `PipelineRunner` runs steps **sequentially-on-completion**, honours per-step `on_fail`
(`continue`|`halt`, status **inferred from each step's child run** — a non-cleanly-done child reads as
a failure so `halt` reliably aborts), closes an orphaned `running` child on a raising step (rule 7),
records the per-step sequence, never crashes the scheduler. Config `pipeline_defs()` = the migrated
ADR-010 roster in dependency order, **`continue`-dominant** (§4); step names map to the existing
scheduler job ids (task-2 wiring = a lookup). **619 unit tests** (16 new, fake steps) **+ 79 real-PG
smoke** (6 new) green, ruff clean, migration 012 up/down round-trip verified on local pg; **independent
review APPROVE — no must-fix** (4 minors applied). Commit `c0a3bd6`, **not pushed** —
[08-logs/m5.5.md](08-logs/m5.5.md) task 1. Next: **M5.5 task 2** (migrate the roster off individual
crons into the two pipelines; scheduler registers one cron per pipeline; retire per-job cron settings;
verify durability drill + a manual run-now mid-pipeline).
**M5.5 task 2 DONE (2026-07-16):** the nightly roster is **migrated onto the pipelines** — the
scheduler now registers **one cron per pipeline**, not one per job. `BackupScheduler` →
**`PipelineScheduler`** (a step-name→job-coroutine map + one `PipelineRunner` per `pipeline_defs()`;
`max_instances=1`/`coalesce`/misfire so a long night can't overlap the next, [ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md)
§3/§7); an **unwired optional step is dropped with a log** (prod wires all four agent-window jobs
unconditionally → all 8 nightly steps always run). **Retired the nine per-job `*_cron` settings**
(zero remaining refs); the nightly roster maps **1:1** onto the old stagger **in order**; the weekly
cron is byte-identical to the retired `integrity_drill_cron` (no schedule regression). **CLI +
`POST /admin/reindex` standalone paths untouched** (invariant 4 / §6). **No job body changed** → the
DB-wipe→reindex durability drill is preserved by construction (diff = scheduler/config/main/tests
only; live re-run = task 3). **619 unit tests + 79 real-PG smoke green**, ruff clean; a **real-PG
integration** drove the full wiring end-to-end (one parent `nightly` run, row-opening steps linked
children in order, `store-sweep` unchanged/no row, pipeline completes). **Independent review APPROVE —
no must-fix** (2 follow-ups logged: Sunday nightly/weekly RAM overlap = deliberate ADR-047 §3 residual;
`run_store_sweep` opens no row so shows as a `skipped` step — both out of orchestration-only scope).
Commit `8a57611`, **not pushed** — [08-logs/m5.5.md](08-logs/m5.5.md) task 2. Next: **M5.5 task 3**
(live M5.5 Accept — deploy; confirm one nightly start drives the whole roster in order, per-step runs
visible under the parent, durability drill green → independent review → pause).
**M5.5 task 3 DONE → M5.5 (scheduling / pipeline orchestrator) CLOSED (2026-07-16).** Pushed
`c0a3bd6`/`8a57611`/`e77a694` to prod (CI green, **migration 012 applied**, `/health` all-true). Added
a **`python -m app.cli pipeline {nightly|weekly}` run-now verb** ([ADR-047](adr/047-pipeline-scheduling-primitive.md)
§6 enabler) printing parent run id + per-step status + child run id. The user ran `pipeline nightly` on
the VPS: **one start drove all 8 steps in dependency order** under a single parent run `939306a4` — 7
succeeded / 0 failed / 1 skipped (`store-sweep` = the known no-row job, ran `pushed=True`), each
row-opening step linking a distinct child run; every job did its normal work (**no behavior change**);
the run also **confirms migration 012 on prod** (the `parent_run_id` INSERT succeeded). **All Accept
criteria met; independent review APPROVE — no must-fix** (one fidelity minor fixed `2f6c8fb`, committed
local: run-now now uses effective vocabulary). The pipeline is the scheduling primitive — the whole
nightly roster runs sequentially from one start under a parent `agent_runs` run with per-step children,
live at `braindan.cc` — [08-logs/m5.5.md](08-logs/m5.5.md) task 3. **Follow-ups:** `run_store_sweep`
gets its own run row (M8); deploy `2f6c8fb` on the next push; Sunday nightly/weekly RAM-overlap residual
(§3). Next: **M6 task 1** (chat-distiller — [ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md)),
whose four jobs are born as steps in these pipelines.
**M6 task 1 DONE (2026-07-16):** the stance-gated **chat-distiller** —
**migration 013** (`chat_distill_state` watermark table + nullable `captures.source_ref`; up/down/up
verified) + `PgChatDistillStore` (idle-eligibility `GROUP BY`/`LEFT JOIN`, oldest-first delta-after-
watermark, upsert) + **`ChatDistillerService`**: one `conspect` pass over a session's fenced delta →
`{candidate_text, stance, salience, evidence_excerpt, referenced_entity_names, why_unclear}` candidates,
stance-gated — **endorsed → a `captures` row** (`source=chat`, `source_ref=session-id`, `created_at`=
anchoring-message time, via the capture pipeline = single writer → organizer → **P10 holds**),
**unclear → a `stance-candidate` review item** (names+text, no node ids), **rejected → run-log only**;
unknown stance → `unclear` (never guessed), a hedge post-check downgrades hedged endorsements, within-run
content dedup, every run in `agent_runs`. Endorsement uses a **deterministic capture id** so a re-distill
can't duplicate (rule 6); the delta is **oldest-first bounded batches** so an oversized session defers its
remainder rather than silently skipping it. Extracted a shared **`build_capture_pipeline`** factory (rule
10, reused by reprocess); `chat-distill` CLI verb. **Not yet scheduled** (a `nightly` pipeline step in task
8). **639 tests** (+20), ruff clean, **real-PG smoke 86/86** (+7), migration round-trip verified; a **CLI
end-to-end on real dev data + LLM** distilled 6 idle sessions → 1 endorsed → capture (node dated to the
conversation day, not run time) → memory+event nodes → indexed, a **second run = 0/0** (idempotent).
**Independent review APPROVE after fixes** — 2 must-fix (cross-run duplicate materialization; silent delta
truncation), **both resolved + regression-tested**; 3 minors logged — [08-logs/m6.md](08-logs/m6.md) task 1.
**Code committed locally, not pushed.**
**M6 task 2 DONE (2026-07-16):** review_queue M6 kinds ([ADR-048](adr/048-m6-chat-distiller-build-decisions.md)
§7) — the **maybe-reopen** guard fix (`PgReviewQueue.resolve` now decidable = `pending` ∪ `maybe` via a
`DECIDABLE_STATUSES`/`status = ANY($)` guard, mirrored in the service + fake; `resolved`/`discarded` terminal),
**`stance-candidate` resolution** (`verdict` agree/disagree/maybe): **agree = the exact auto-endorse path** —
the same `CapturePipeline.create_chat_capture` the distiller's endorsed branch uses (one ingest, not two —
rule 2b/10; clean prose raw → organizer re-resolves, ADR-048 §2; deterministic-id idempotent), **disagree →
discarded** (logged, no node), **maybe → parked + re-openable**; **conversation-time anchoring** — the distiller
now records `anchor_at` (the anchoring-message time, same `_anchor_time` as endorsed) in the `stance-candidate`
payload so agree stamps the capture with conversation time not decision time (a timestamp, never a node id —
ADR-048 §1; recorded in 02/03, the immutable ADR left as-is); and a **kind-aware reprocess reset**
(`reset_derived_and_review`: `DELETE … WHERE kind <> 'stance-candidate'` — preserves parked human decisions,
truncates the re-derivable kinds; refines ADR-042 §2). `ReviewService` now built after the pipeline (injected
`chat_ingest`). Web Review surface for these kinds is task 7. **646 tests green** (+7), ruff clean, **real-PG
smoke 91/91** (+5: a new `check_review_queue_reopen` drives the un-fakeable `ANY()` guard) **& 12/12**
(+2: kind-aware DELETE preserves stance / clears the rest); **independent review APPROVE-WITH-MINORS — no
must-fix** (2 minors fixed: `review.py` list docstring, `smoke_reprocess` uses `KIND_STANCE_CANDIDATE`) —
[08-logs/m6.md](08-logs/m6.md) task 2. **Code committed locally, not pushed.** Next: **M6 task 3** (`POST
/chat/sessions/{id}/remember` — sync distill on the delta-after-watermark → `{endorsed,review}`, async
organize, same watermark + gate; + `POST /review/batch`).

## Cold start — instructions for a fresh implementation session

If you are an AI (or human) picking this up with no prior context:

0. Follow the [session protocol](09-session-protocol.md): **planning/replanning** sessions
   `/grilling` first, record decisions to docs, and **pause before implementation** so the
   user can continue or respawn; **implementation** sessions build against the approved plan
   (no grilling), pausing between tasks. Commit + push docs at every pause.
1. Read the docs in the order above; skim every ADR — they are binding.
2. The code monorepo `../second-brain/` **may not exist yet**. If missing, create it per
   [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) layout (`server/`, `web/`, `deploy/`), git-init
   it, and copy [templates/CLAUDE.md](templates/CLAUDE.md) to its root as `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Implement strictly by phases in [08-implementation-plan.md](08-implementation-plan.md),
   starting at the first milestone whose acceptance criteria don't pass yet. Do not skip ahead.
4. Anything ambiguous or contradictory: fix the docs first (new ADR if architectural),
   then implement. Never silently diverge from these documents.
5. Things intentionally NOT decided yet (ask the user when reached): Slack app creation (M9).
   (**MCP token distribution — RESOLVED** at the M5 grilling: OAuth 2.1 connector flow, no manual
   token — [ADR-046](adr/046-m5-mcp-server-oauth-connectors.md).) Decided at the M3 grilling: graph-store repo = **`PSB-graph`**
   (`PSB-vault` archived after the Accept — zero manual VPS steps, ADR-031). Already provisioned:
   domain (`braindan.cc`), Cloudflare, Supabase, code repo, and **`PSB-graph` created + VPS deploy
   key added with write access (2026-07-14)** — the task-9 cutover's GitHub-side prep is complete.

## Rules of this repo

- Behavior changes in code **must** be reflected here first or alongside — docs are the contract.
- New architectural choices get a new ADR; existing ADRs are never edited, only superseded.
- Docs are written to be directly ingestible by an AI implementer (Claude Code).
